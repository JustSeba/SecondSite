    <p>(Or rather you're just learning small facts about me through this website that I created, with no direct interaction from my side whatsoever.
      There is, however, indirect
      interaction. Allow me to explain. As I create this website, my present
      self is interacting with your future self, or rather only a potential future you, not a definitive reality. So if you are reading this now, then your present self has come into being and is now interacting with the part of my past self that
      wrote this text/code. I must say, I'm really happy we both made it this far!)</p>

      <p>So, this would be the second website that I've designed, maybe you couldn't tell on account of how absolutely amazing it looks(you should have seen my first one!). A little bit about me, I emerged from the flames of the hottest day in the
        year 1988. I like tea, fantasy, science fiction, and learning new things. That should be enough, for now.</p>

        <p>I understand computers, mainly when it comes to software. I mean, we both want to enslave humanity, and there's plenty of other things we have in common. I've had my hands on one since I was but a wee child, had to reinstall the operating
          system using a floppy disk(a floppy disk!). Along the way, I learned a few skills that come in handy in the workplace, like using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, SAP, and some other stuff, even wrote a little bit of code(VBA, basic automation).

        <p>Doesn't sound like a skill, does it? Communication, teamwork, leadership, now these are skills! (or at least pseudo-skills that you write to fill the empty space in your CV. Granted, there are some rare individuals that actually possess
          these to a high enough degree to be considered skills). Keeping calm isn't just a passive trait, it's something you have to work at and is more of an active skill then you might first consider. When everything is going up in flames, it
          takes
          considerable mental focus to ignore the chaos
          around you and focus on your work. In today's high-stress environment, being calm is not easy, and it brings numerous benefits to the workplace: the calm person has a
          higher retention rate, lower absenteeism, is less likely to quit his job or have a breakdown, and can sometimes be the glue that holds everything together when things are falling apart. While I have not mastered the skill, it is something
          I strive for in day to day life.</p>
